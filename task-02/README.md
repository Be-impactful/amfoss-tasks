# Linux and Git
This task was super fun! :star_struck: I not only just had fun finding the password, 
it also made me learn a good amount of git commands and how git works in itself.
Detailed terminal commands which i have used is given in [SOLUTION.md](https://github.com/Be-impactful/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-02/SOLUTION.md) file.

I approached this task by carefully reading the given steps and searching a bunch of things online.
After following it, it was a breeze to the end. The [solution](https://github.com/Be-impactful/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-02/solution) to the task and the [screenshot](https://github.com/Be-impactful/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-02/task02.png) of the pdf are also uploaded.
