## My views about the tasks
After doing 9 out of main 11 tasks i have to say it was a unique selection of questions which really made me Think Better! Thank you amFOSS!
After all this is all for making ourselves better so that we can solve problems in the realworld, and i think this is a very good intro to what have to see next, and I'm super excited for it!
## My Introduction
Hi Seniors üôè I'm Hemanth from Palakkad Kerala. I came to know about amFOSS from quora and even though being very much interested in Technology
and computer science, I always love to study and explore fields that are wastly different. But CS stood out to me mostly because i like developing new thing which could be useful to others as well as problem solving. Python is the language that i know the most followed by C & Java. With these tasks, i feel better grip over these languages, and find myself to Think better.
