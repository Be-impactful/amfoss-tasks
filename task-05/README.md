# FindTheBug
This task gave an insight to how Server-Client systems work, and how they are linked together. Moreover, 
it was super fun and felt like a detective while doing this :joy:

After referring the links given in the task and with a bit of researching, this task went well :smile:

The program after fixing the bugs is shown in the [video](https://github.com/Be-impactful/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-05/task5.mp4) below.
