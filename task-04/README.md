# CineBot
This task was really interesting! :smile: This gave me an intro of how to solve a real-world problem using whatever i have learnt, and moreover,
it gave me an insight of how to deal with api calls and other cool things we can do with Telegram bots! And being written in python, which I'm comfortable with,
it was really easy to understand and to carry forward.

The final working of the Bot is given in the [gif](https://github.com/Be-impactful/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-04/task4.gif) below.
