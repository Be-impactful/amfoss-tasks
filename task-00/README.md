# Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
This task was easy :smile: but with some small challenges. When i first installed Ubuntu everything worked as expected,
but when i booted into windows and tried to get back into linux again,
ubuntu was missing from bootable media in BIOS. I tried to install it a few more times but nothing resorted.
Then i decided to try Linux Mint 21.1 as it's also an ubuntu based distro, and it worked Great! and was shown up in BIOS too.
That made me switch from windows to mint, and now i use linux for almost all of my purposes! :blush:
