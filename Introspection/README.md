# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
Being able to create new things is something which i love to do, and at that point in time there is nothing which is boring; nothing which makes me go back,
and whenever people make things with good intension, the output will always turn out to be good, no matter the circumstance. And for that reason amfoss can 
think of choosing me for the club. I think amfoss could lead me to the path which i could use to build myself and the community.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I was amazed by the things that we can do with flutter app and would like to learn about more and develop good apps based on it. Also DSA is in main focus
to build up my problem solving and logical thinking skills.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would work to my extent, and will make the club's name better by achieving something great in future.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No, this selection process is one of which is so extensive that it would test us in a fundamental way compared to others and would let us to Think better
which is a unique part of getting into amFOSS.
